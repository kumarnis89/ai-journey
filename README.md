# 🚀 AI / ML Learning Journey

Welcome to my public learning journal where I document everything I learn about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** — one day at a time.

This site is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and hosted freely using **GitHub Pages**.

📍 **Live Site**: [https://kumarnis89.github.io/ai-journey](https://kumarnis89.github.io/ai-journey)

## 🧠 About This Project

I started this project to:
- Stay consistent in my AI/ML learning journey
- Create a public knowledge base
- Track my progress over time
- Help others who are beginning their own journey

## 🗓️ Daily Logs

Each day, I:
- Read articles, books, or watch videos
- Write a short summary of what I learned
- Post it as a daily log

The logs are dynamically rendered on the landing page from a simple JavaScript object (`script.js`).
